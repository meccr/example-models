# Remote Measuring Use Case

Based on [ISTE-SQA/remote_measuring](https://github.com/ISTE-SQA/remote_measuring/tree/master/remote-measuring-pcm).

This example keeps all models from the source, but adds a model for the SLOs (`rm.slo`) and adds additional information to some of the existing models. 
These are:
* Costs for the Resources Environment.
* More measuring points and monitors.
