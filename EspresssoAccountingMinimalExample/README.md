# Espresso Accounting Example

Based on [another Espresso Accounting Example](https://github.com/PalladioSimulator/Palladio-Addons-ExperimentAutomation/tree/b2f68ad218a82cdbc5bb2786f97d0e8d147a26d7/bundles/org.palladiosimulator.experimentautomation.examples.espresso) that is probably already a copy of [yet another Espresso Accounting Example](https://github.com/PalladioSimulator/Palladio-Example-Models/tree/0e347e695609484cfb795d20dbe0dfc0988f3ee2/Minimum_Project_Example).

This example keeps all models from the source, but add new models required in the MENTOR context. 
These are:
* Load intensity (`espresso.dlim`)
* SPD-base Scaling Policies (`espresso.spd`and `espresso.semanticspd`) 
* Costs for the Resources Environment.
* More measuring points and monitors.
